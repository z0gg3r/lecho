.SH BUGS
.B lecho
reads from stdin until it receives a blank line, thus it will only read until the first blank line. Input that contains
blank lines (i.e. for readability) should be used with the \-f option, since this will read the entire file, including
the blank lines.

.SH NOTES
.B lecho
expects files to be valid CSV if given the \-c option. If your file uses delimiters that
deviate from the standard (that is a comma), please use the \-d option.
